  <h1>A LOVE NOT MINE</h1>

 <h2 style="font-size:32px;">Chap1: How it all started</h2>
<p>It was a rainy afternoon and there by the glass door stood a girl in her twenties, 
    her skin was mocha and had a black curly hair tied into a side bun. She was staring 
    through the glass door watching as the rain poured heavily outside. The view 
    outside was a little foggy but one could still see the paved way from the glass door 
    up to the gate a distance away. Once standing outside the glass door one could see 
    the little greenhouse garden standing inches away on the right side and the 
    beautiful drenched green grass right in front of the greenhouse and the little paved 
    way leading to the greenhouse’s door.</p>
  <h3 style="font-size:32px;">Chap2: A crazy request</h3> 
  <p>That night, everyone was gathered around the bed as they soothed a sobbing 
    Payton. She was lying there on the bed, her eyes closed as tears flowed down her 
    cheeks. "Payton dear, don't worry. Everything will be alright" pleaded her mother 
    as she rubbed her hand in circles. "No mom, nothing will be alright without my 
    sight. I…am…now…blind" cried Payton. "No Toni, look on the bright side. The 
    doctor said that if you get a corneal transplant you will be able to see again" 
    assured Paris.</p>
  <h4 style="font-size:32px;">Chap3: A date with Richard</h4>
  <p>"Okay, tell me everything I need to know before dating Richard Randall." Said 
    Paris. Her mother looked at her surprised and at the same time happy. Payton was 
    smiling happy that her sister had agreed to help her. "Right away Paris" answered 
    Payton with the same smile on her face.
After hours of listening, learning and reflecting on what Payton had taught and told 
her, Paris felt that she was finally ready to meet her sister's fiancé or should I say, 
her fiancé. The three of them were sitting on Payton's bed when Mr. Moore came 
in with a smile on his face.</p>
  <h5 style="font-size:32px;">Chap4: Fate decides</h5>
  <p>Paris opened the front door and went in. Both her mother and twin were waiting 
    for her in the living room. She sat in the sofa, beside Payton, and let out a loud sigh 
    as she bent down to remove the heels she was wearing and then rested her head on 
    the back of the sofa. "So how did it go?" asked her twin as she patted on the sofa 
    reaching out for Paris' hand. Paris rolled her head to look at her, "And who sent 
    that message to Richard? Do you know that he almost gave me a heart attack! 
    Whose crazy idea was that?" she asked.</p>
